## Navigation System Update

- Implemented a dropdown navigation system directly within the `Header` global configuration.
- Created a new field type `navDropdownLink` in `src/fields/navDropdownLink.ts` that extends the basic `link` field to support dropdown menus.
- The `navDropdownLink` field allows for:
  - A main link item.
  - A checkbox to enable/disable the dropdown.
  - A `dropdownContent` group field (shown conditionally) containing:
    - `header`: Rich text field for the dropdown header.
    - `links`: An array of standard link fields for the dropdown items.
    - `footer`: Rich text field for the dropdown footer.
    - `featuredContent`: A group field for promotional content (title, description, image, link).
- Updated `src/Header/config.ts` to replace the simple `link` array in `navItems` with the new `navDropdownLink`.
- Modified the `src/Header/Nav/index.tsx` component to:
  - Render navigation items using the new structure.
  - Include state management (`useState`) to handle dropdown visibility.
  - Add a button with a `ChevronDown` icon to toggle dropdowns.
  - Conditionally render the `dropdownContent` based on the dropdown state.
  - Include helper functions to render rich text and dropdown content layout (simplified for now).
- Updated `src/Header/RowLabel.tsx` to indicate in the admin UI whether a navigation item has a dropdown enabled.
